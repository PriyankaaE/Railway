# Production_packaging

This code is all about how to make the Ml model production ready.

Tox is used to build packages and run the code.
Tox is a generic virtual environment management and test command line tool you can use for:
1. Checking your package builds and installs correctly under different environments (such as different Python implementations, versions or installation dependencies),
2. Running your tests in each of the environments with the test tool of choice,
3. Acting as a frontend to continuous integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.

Pytest is used as a testing framework that originated from the PyPy project. It can be used to write various types of software tests, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and functional tests. Its features include parametrized testing, fixtures, and assert re-writing.

To run the code use

tox

It starts the server.
